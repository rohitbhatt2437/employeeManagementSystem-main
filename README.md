To implement Role Based Access control, I have made an employee management system.

1. run the command 'npm i'
2. run the command 'npm run dev'
3. You can login in two ways:
 (i) Admin: To login as an admin use username as 'admin@me.com' and password as '123'. Here you can assign task to user.
 (ii) employee: To login as an employee i have taken 5 example employees in the local storage file which are 'employee1@example.com', 'employee2@example.com' and so on till 'employee5@example.com' all of them have the password '123'. In the employee interface we can see the tasks that have been assigned, completed and failed. 

 Note: There is a small bug in the admin interface that sometimes  when we assign a task to a new user for the first time it does not get alloted, but after first ime it works properly
